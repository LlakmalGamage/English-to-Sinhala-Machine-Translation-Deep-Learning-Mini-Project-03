# Transformer-Based English to Sinhala Machine Translator
Welcome to the Transformer-Based English to Sinhala Machine Translator project repository! This project is developed as part of my deep learning course. The data for training this model has been collected through manual methods and web scraping techniques. Additionally, expect updates and new versions to be added over time.

# Overview
This project focuses on implementing a machine translation system using Transformer architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The collected dataset comprises data obtained through manual collection processes and web scraping methodologies. The goal is to build a robust translation system capable of accurately translating from English to Sinhala.

# Contents

Preprocessed Data: Includes preprocessed datasets ready for training the machine translation model.
Model Training Code: Houses code for training the Transformer model on the collected data.
Model Evaluation: Provides scripts and notebooks for evaluating the performance of the trained model.

# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Use the provided scripts to collect additional data if needed.
Preprocess the collected data using the provided scripts.
Train the Transformer model using the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the trained model using evaluation scripts and notebooks.
Utilize the inference scripts to make translations from English to Sinhala with the trained model.

# Future Updates
Expect future updates to this repository, including:

Improvements to data collection processes.
Enhancements to the Transformer model architecture.
Expansion of the dataset with additional sources and languages.
Integration of advanced techniques for improving translation quality.
